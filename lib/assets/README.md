## Wordpress theme-specific asset files

This directory contains any asset files (js or css) that are required in order to make the NAAV
calculator populate the calculated NAAV on the main index page as well as style and display the
NAAV rate chart at the bottom of the homepage.

### Wordpress version : 4.7.3
### Theme name: yootheme
### Theme version: 1.3.8

#### File Locations:

|Local File |Theme File |
|-----------|:---------:|
|custom.css |/wp-content/themes/yootheme/css/custom.css|
|theme.js|/wp-content/themes/yootheme/js/theme.js|

#### @todo:
*Build an small install script that can be used to update the theme's files inside wordpress automatically without
overwriting them so that the theme and wordpress itself can be updated without much hassle or concern of overwriting
working code*
